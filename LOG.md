### Shipped
- Day 1 Coding: Worked on Math Functions, Operators, and the data types Int and Float.

- Day 1: AI work: Worked on learning about LLMS and Prompt Engineering

### Learned
- Difference between int and float. 
- operator precedence
- checking types

- LLM's use natural language processing
- Tokens are used in GPT and they each have their own Token ID
- If asked to roll a dice, things aren't completely random. Tokens have a probability chance of following previous tokens and the highest probability can most likely be picked.
- Temperature controls randomness

### Next
- Learning Variables and Strings (str)
- Continuing through the Data Types

- Transformer Model
- Learning the training process
