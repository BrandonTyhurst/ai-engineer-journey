    In my life, I have been known to jump from job to job because I find myself getting bored easily.
I also really enjoy learning. I get a kick from any new knowledge that I can learn.
I believe that this is part of why I move around so much in life because I am always eager and willing to learn something new. 
I would rather learn many things than to perfect one. 

    However, doing this has held me back from some amazing opportunities. I want to be the best at something in life. 
Learning AI Engineerin is extremely interesting to me as I truly enjoy technology and there is always going to be something new to learn.
AI is growing rapidly and there is always something new to learn. I want to put my all into becoming the best AI Engineer possible. 
I want to be one of the greatest and someone that people turn to when wanting to learn AI.
